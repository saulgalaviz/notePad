# NotePad

Extracurricular work aimed at simulating the default Windows Notepad, developed using Java along with the
Java Swing graphical user interface library.

Attentively copied feature by feature for each of those in the Windows Notepad, carefully replicating the drop
down menu along with hot key commands that are presented within the Windows version.
